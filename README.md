# NBA-Shot-Value-Prediction-and-Analysis
For a final project in a Machine Learning course, myself and three fellow students built a model to predict the value of an NBA shot based on location factors, action type (i.e. dunk, jump shot), and other game related information (i.e. time remaining, home/away, etc.). We notably left player name out of the modeling process, which surely affected model performance, but also gave us a lot of power in analyzing the model results. We were able to compare the model's expectation over all of a single player's shots against the actual results that player produced. The concept of points produced over prediction, or expectation, is extremely useful in analysis of a player's performance. Our results showed that players such as Nikola Jokic, Steph Curry, and Kevin Durant produce the most value on their shots in 2023, as any NBA fan would expect. However, we also noticed some players, including Luke Kennard, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Buddy Hield, that received little attention for their play in 2023, but according to our analysis had incredible scoring seasons.
